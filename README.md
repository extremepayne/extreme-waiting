## What
This program takes a percentage and converts it to a date. As the percentage increases, the date goes back in time exponentially. This helps alleviate boredom caused by waiting.

## How
Run the appropriate version of main.py. (main_with_curses if your system supports curses package, main otherwise.) Enter the amount of time you have to wait for. It will display a percent (and a progress bar, for main_with_curses) and a date and/or significant events on or near that date.
